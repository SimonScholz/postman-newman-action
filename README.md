# postman-newman-action

Run newman/postman collections via GitHub actions using newman 6.0.0 and newman run summary as action output for further notifications.

First of all, thanks a lot to the users [@anthonyvscode](https://github.com/anthonyvscode/newman-action) and [@matt-ball](https://github.com/matt-ball/newman-action) for creating their newman-actions, which I took as reference for this action.
What I try to accomplish with this new action is to have the best of both worlds (@anthonyvscode's + @matt-ball`s actions) + more up to date versions of dependencies.

- Making use of all available NewmanRunOptions as input
- Using node 20 instead of node 12
- Use a newer version of the newman library (6.0.0)
- Set the summary of the newman run as output, so that followup actions can use the summary, e.g., for more sophisticated notifications.

If I find time I'd also intend to include sending notifications about the run for popular messengers.

## Example Usage

```yaml
  postman-newman-action:
    name: Run Postman Newman GitHub Actions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        id: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Postman collection
        id: postman-newman-action
        uses: SimonScholz/postman-newman-action@main
        with:
            collection: "./collections/your-collection.json"
```

## Sending a summary card v2 to a Google Chat

```yaml
name: Run Postman Newman Action

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: "* */2 * * *" # run the action every 2 hours

  postman-newman-action:
    name: GitHub Actions Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        id: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Postman collection
        id: postman-newman-action
        uses: SimonScholz/postman-newman-action@main
        with:
          collection: "./collections/your-collection.json"
          outputGoogleCardV2: true

      - name: Notify Google Chat
        if: ${{ always() }} # Use always to ensure that the notification is also send on former failure
        uses: SimonScholz/google-chat-action@main
        with:
          webhookUrl: '${{ secrets.GOOGLE_CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL }}'
          additionalSections: '${{ steps.postman-newman-action.outputs.googleCardV2 }}'
          jobStatus: '${{ job.status }}'
          imageUrl: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7853266/44114706-9c72dd08-9fd1-11e8-8d9d-6d9d651c75ad.png
          imageAltText: 'Postman Image'

```

Besides `if: ${{ always() }}` you can of course also use any other if statement, e.g., `if: ${{ failure() }}` to only send a message on failure.

## Concatenate outputs from several collection runs using jq

You might also want to concatenate the different `googleCardV2` cards into one large card sections array so that only one card is sent at the end instead of one for every collection.

jq is a command line json parser, which can also read different json objects line by line using the `--slurp / -s` command:

```yaml
- name: Concat outputGoogleCardV2 output using jq
  id: concat-google-card-v2
  run: |
    CONCATINATED_ARRAY=echo -e "${{ steps.postman-newman-action.outputs.googleCardV2 }}\n${{ steps.postman-newman-action-two.outputs.googleCardV2 }}" | jq -s 'add'
    echo "GOOGLE_CHAT_SECTIONS_ARRAY=$CONCATINATED_ARRAY" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
```

- `echo -e` causes the `\n` to be converted into real new lines
- `jq -s 'add'` lets jq "slurp" json objects line by line while `'add'` will do the concatenation
- The result will then be written to the `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`

A complete example would look like this:

```yaml
name: Run Postman Newman Action

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: "* */2 * * *" # run the action every 2 hours

  postman-newman-action:
    name: GitHub Actions Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        id: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Postman collection
        id: postman-newman-action
        uses: SimonScholz/postman-newman-action@main
        with:
          collection: "./collections/your-collection.json"
          outputGoogleCardV2: true

      - name: Run Postman 2nd collection
        id: postman-newman-action-two
        uses: SimonScholz/postman-newman-action@main
        with:
          collection: "./collections/your-2nd-collection.json"
          outputGoogleCardV2: true

      - name: Concat outputGoogleCardV2 output using jq
        id: concat-google-card-v2
        run: |
          CONCATINATED_ARRAY=echo -e "${{ steps.postman-newman-action.outputs.googleCardV2 }}\n${{ steps.postman-newman-action-two.outputs.googleCardV2 }}" | jq -s 'add'
          echo "GOOGLE_CHAT_SECTIONS_ARRAY=$CONCATINATED_ARRAY" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"

      - name: Notify Google Chat
        if: ${{ always() }}
        uses: SimonScholz/google-chat-action@main
        with:
          title: 'Concatenated Google Chat Card'
          webhookUrl: '${{ secrets.GOOGLE_CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL }}'
          additionalSections: '${{ steps.concat-google-card-v2.outputs.GOOGLE_CHAT_SECTIONS_ARRAY }}'
          jobStatus: '${{ job.status }}'
